BRIEF OVERVIEW OF WHAT MORSE CODE IS

Morse code is a method of communication that is uses a series of dots and dashes to relay information in conjunction with an electromagnetic telegraph.
By harnessing the telegraphs ability to transmit electric pulses it revolutionized communication. 
It allowed messages to be sent across long distances within minutes.

HISTORICAL CONTEXT OF WHY MORSE CODE WAS CREATED

In the past there were different methods for sending long-distance messages.
such as smoke signals ect later societies branched off and used semaphore,
a system of flags raised to certain positions to to indicate letters and numbers.
This method was effective but had many limitations such as the distance at which they could be used
as well as the weather conditions that impacted their efficiency.
There was a great need for a long distance system that would work efficiently with fewer hindrances.
So in the early 1800s advances in  electricity created a new window of opportunity for inventors to create a device 
known as the telegraph.

Samuel Morse who lived from 1791 to 1872 originally trained as a painter 
became interested in electricity and tinkered with it for nearly 12 years before perfecting 
his version of an electric telegraph.

HOW MORSE CODE SYSTEM WORKS 

The codes are transmitted as electrical pulses of varied lengths or analogues
mechanical or visual signals,such as flashing lights are then represented in either 
alphabet,numerals and punctuation marks by an arrangement of dots, dashes and spaces.
